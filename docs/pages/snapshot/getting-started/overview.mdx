# Overview

## What is Snaplet?

Snaplet is an **all-in-one developer tool** that gives developers **realistic, production-like data** that they can code against.

There are two ways to obtain production-like data with Snaplet: either by [capturing](/snapshot/core-concepts/capture) an existing source database into a **snapshot**, or by [generating](/seed/core-concepts) fake data using AI.

### Snapshots
**Snapshots** are database snapshots [captured](/snapshot/core-concepts/capture) from an existing database you can access (typically production). Snapshots can be [subset](/snapshot/core-concepts/capture) (reduced in size) and the source data can be [transformed](/snapshot/core-concepts/capture) to your requirements (for example, obfuscating personally identifiable information). Snapshots are restored into a database as part of your workflow, whether that's your local coding environment, a cloud environment, or CI/CD.

## Quick Start
Follow the [snapshot quick start](/getting-started/quick-start/snapshot) guide to get production-like data in your workflow.

If you don't have a database you can connect to, or would prefer to seed data using our AI seed feature, follow the [`seed` quick start guide](/getting-started/quick-start/seed) instead.

## Key Features

- **Capture data:** Create a database snapshot from your existing database.
- **Restore data:** Code against your snapshot by restoring it to a database.
