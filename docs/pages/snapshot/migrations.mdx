# Snapshot migration

## From `0.71.0` and above

We fixed a long-standing bug in the snapshot capture and restore process about `NULL` values.

If you captured a snapshot with a version of Snaplet CLI below `0.71.0`, you can either:

- Capture a new snapshot, which will save it to the new fixed format (recommended):
```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx snaplet@latest snapshot capture
```

- Or run the restore command with the last version of Snaplet CLI before the fix:
```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx snaplet@0.70.1 snapshot restore
```
