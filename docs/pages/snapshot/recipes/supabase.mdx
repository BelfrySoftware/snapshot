For restoring data into your Supabase project, only the `public` and `auth` schemas are supported. If you experience any issues with any of the paths, reach out to us on [Discord](https://app.snaplet.dev/chat).

## Restoring to a Supabase local development stack

Supabase makes it easy to start a project with a dedicated PostgreSQL database. However, achieving a development environment populated with data closely resembling producation, still requires some set up.
This guide will help you restore a snapshot of your production database into your local development stack.

#### 1. Connect your source database (Production Database)

Navigate to https://www.snaplet.dev and sign up for a new account (it's free). Once you have successfully signed up for a new account, you'll begin the onboarding process...

![Snaplet onboarding select team name](/recipes/supabase/onboarding_start.webp)

On the “Connect database” step click on "Connect Supabase" to connect your Supabase account to Snaplet. Proceed through all the steps of authorizing your Supabase organization, select a project and then enter the password associated to the project.

![Snaplet onboarding connect your database](/recipes/supabase/connect_to_supabase.webp)

> The snapshot configuration generated during onboarding will be set to only capture the `public` and `auth` schemas. Learn more [below](#excluding-specific-schemas-from-snapshots).

#### 2: Create a snapshot

Continue to the next steps:

- Subsetting (skipping will create a snapshot with all your data).
- Transforming (skipping will leave all your table columns untouched).

Once you have gone through all these steps, a new snapshot process will start and you will now be on the “capture step.” Wait for it to finish - this is the snapshot you will restore into your **target database.**

#### 3: Set up your Supabase local development stack

Below is a summary of commands you will have to run in your terminal to get Supabase set up on your local machine. For more detailed steps you can visit the Supabase docs [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/local-development).

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
# log in to the Supabase CLI
supabase login

# initialize your Supabase configuration in your project folder
supabase init

# with docker running, start your Supabase services
supabase start
```

Running `supabase start` will output your Supabase credentials, copy the **DB_URL** field, as we will paste it in your `snaplet.config.ts` file (step 5).

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
Started supabase local development setup.

         API URL: http://localhost:54321
          DB URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres
      Studio URL: http://localhost:54323
    Inbucket URL: http://localhost:54324
        anon key: eyJh......
service_role key: eyJh......
```

#### 4: Install the Snaplet CLI

1. Open your terminal and run `curl -sL https://app.snaplet.dev/get-cli/ | bash`
2. Run `snaplet auth login`
3. Navigate to `https://app.snaplet.dev/access-token/cli` to get your access token.
4. Paste the access token in the terminal.

#### 5: Config setup

1. Navigate to your project directory.

2. Set up your snaplet config.

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
snaplet setup
```

```bash >_&nbsp; terminal
# mark
✔ Welcome to Snaplet! 😸 Choose your adventure: › I want to capture or restore a snapshot 💾

Target database credentials
Snaplet restores data to your target database using the target database credentials.

# mark
✔ Target database connection string … postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres
📡 Connected to database with "[secret]ql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres"

# mark
✔ Select or create a project › My Team > My Project

You're all set! Take a look at our docs to find out what you can do from here:
https://docs.snaplet.dev/getting-started/start-here/

Restore latest snapshot:
To restore the latest snapshot in your project execute the command:
snaplet ss restore --latest

Local capture:
You can learn more about self hosting here: https://docs.snaplet.dev/guides/self-hosting

To capture a snapshot of your local database first pull the full configuration with:
snaplet config pull

Then capture the snapshot with:
SNAPLET_SOURCE_DATABASE_URL=<database-url> snaplet ss capture
```

#### 6: Restore the data target

You are now ready to restore!

1. Run `snaplet snapshot restore` in your project path.

> **Note:** for supabase projects we automatically include the `--no-reset` flag when running `snaplet snapshot restore`. So no existing schemas will be dropped. Learn more about data operations [here](/core-concepts/capture)

### All done!

If you want to learn more about Snaplet, you can explore our docs. If you have any questions, reach out to us on [Discord](https://app.snaplet.dev/chat).

That's it! You're all done, and should have restored a version of your Supabase production database with transformed data into your target database. You can now code against production-realistic data.

### Troubleshooting

#### Excluding specific schemas from snapshots

Snaplet does not support restoring all the schemas in a Supabase instance. By default your config will be set to only capture the `public` and `auth` schemas.
You can manually include other schemas, but this is not a supported use case for this integration.

> Schemas such as `storage` and `supabase_functions` schemas are excluded, because Snaplet is unable to also the clone the infrastructure required to support these schemas.

Your snapshot config should look something like this:

```ts snaplet.config.ts
defineConfig({
  select: {
    $default: false,
    public: true,
    auth: true,
    // you can manually include schemas here, e.g: when you enable an extension and that
    // extension creates a schema. Note: including any other schemas other than the "public"
    // and "auth" schemas, may break the state of your Supabase project.
  }
})
```

During onboarding, this `select` option is automatically added to your config. In the web editor you will be shown a warning, if you choose to remove the `$default` field.

#### Reset supabase database

Use the `supabase db reset` command to reset the state of your Supabase project.
This is useful for cases a snapshot breaks your project, or you want to start from a clean slate.

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
# reset your supabase database
supabase db reset

# restore your snapshot
snaplet snapshot restore
```
