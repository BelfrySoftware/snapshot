# Connection Strings

In order to connect to your source database, Snaplet needs read-only database credentials in the form of a connection string, or connection URL.

A PostgreSQL connection URL specifies the following parameters:

* **username** (the username used to connect to the database)
* **password** (the password used in the "user" parameter)
* **hostname** (the IP address or domain name of the machine where the server is running)
* **port** (port number on which the server is listening on)
* **database** (name of the database to connect to)

This connection string may also include a collection of optional parameter keywords that allow adjustments of various aspects of the URL (e.g. SSL, timeouts, etc).

Here's an example connection string:

```bash
postgresql://username:password@hostname:5432/database_name
```

### Troubleshooting connection strings

When passing in a connection string to Snaplet, we will attempt to validate and encode the connection string, however you may still have problems with database names or passwords and special characters **`(%&/:=?@[])`**, in this case you may have to URI encode your username and/or your password.

Let's take an example in which your database password is `p@$$w0rd!`.

You first need to encode the password using [encodeURIComponent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent) or [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/):

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
# encodeURIComponent
node -e 'console.log(encodeURIComponent("p@$$w0rd!"))'
p%40%24%24w0rd!

# jq
printf %s 'p@$$w0rd!' | jq -sRr @uri
p%40%24%24w0rd!
```

You can then paste the encoded password into your connection string:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
# focus[52:66]
SNAPLET_SOURCE_DATABASE_URL='postgresql://john-doe:p%40%24%24w0rd!@hostname:5432/production' snaplet snapshot capture
```
